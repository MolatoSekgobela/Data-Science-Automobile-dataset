# Data-Science-Capstone-Project-2

The  aim of the project was to design EDA and data visualisation using the automobile dataset

Auto-mobile data set consists of three types of entities:

1. The specification of a vehicle based on a number of various characteristics (make,
   fuel-type, aspiration, number-of-doors, body-style etc.).
2. Its insurance risk rating.
3. Its normalized losses in use as compared to other vehicle.
   A risk factor is assigned on the vehicles linked to its price. +3 depicts that the vehicle is risky
   while 3 the auto is less risky. Lastly the average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This
   value is normalized for all vehicles within a particular size classification.
   
This project is used to bench mark and show case my skills on Exploratory Data Analysis and data visualization using different libraries.
this forms part od my data science boot capm training with hyperion Dev.

My porject includes:

1. jupyter notebook
2. Dataset used
3. Report on my findings 


Usage:

1. download the dataset and the notebook into your working directory
2. open the notebook in jupyter to see the code used to analyse the dataset.
3. ensure python3 is installed ( follow link  on how to install python https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows)
4. use the report for better understanding of the findings after analysis
